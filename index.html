    <h2 style="background-color: #4CAF50; color: white; padding: 10px;">Why did I choose these assignments?</h2>
    <p>
<b>English Premier League website design:</b> My EPL website was essentially a demo to show how a website was organized, what I've done is attached a .png photo of my homepage for my 'unofficial English Premier League website'. I chose this piece of work mainly for the execution of this assignment. When viewing the assignment (which is done by clicking on the button above under 'My 5 best pieces of work") visually in my opinion it looks very good while following the concept of A.I.D.A by keeping the homepage simple, not filling it with too much text while still being clear on the purpose of the webpage to not lose the audience's attention. To add on, the logo of the English Premier League was seamlessly added into the website where the purple used in the background of the lion is used in the header and footer to also catch the eye of the attended audience (fans of football; mainly the premier league) who would recognize the color palette.

<b>Blog:</b> This assignment as stated in the "How my skills are applied" section says that the blog assignment shows how well I can use word-processing softwares, specifically Google Docs which was the one used for this assignment. If you open the assignment via the button in the "My 5 best pieces of work" section, you can see the document now converted to a PDF. Firstly, I show a good demonstration on cropping and resizing images in a document as shown on the image above my text. I also show the usage of readable fonts which fit the theme of a blog. Thirdly, I show how to change the size of the text, the ability to make the text size of the title and body of text sensible as well the line spacing between the title and the first paragraph.
<br>
<br>
    </p>
    <p>
<b>GolfAssign Task:</b> This assignment is a spreadsheet listing. This assignment was a good example as it shows my ability to use spreadsheet softwares such as Google Sheets, Microsoft Excel, and many more. The GolfAssign Task was given as a test to show how well I can apply my skills into spreadsheet softwares. As a final task for spreadsheets, the idea of the Golf Assign Task was to test the application we learned to spreadsheet softwares meaning that this assignment covers most if not all of what I know of spreadsheet softwares. First off, the GolfAssign Task shows how I can use formulas to make any work done on a spreadsheet much more efficient, especially if I have to deal with much larger amounts of data which would otherwise be much longer. Also I show in the spreadsheet that I know how to take information from a spreadsheet and use it to make a chart to visually represent the data. There are many more minute examples that show my experience in spreadsheet software applications.
<br>
<br>

    <p>
<b>Social Media Pledge:</b> My social media pledge is a pledge I have made on being a good digital citizen. The reason why I chose this assignment is not because of the work I did making the pledge but the background of the pledge which I put together from scratch which I feel very proud of. In the background I put a mix match of the logos of social media platforms. I also put a translucent shape behind the next to make the background still visible while keeping the text readable.
<br>
<br>
    </p>
    <p>
<b>New Workstation Task:</b> This assignment shows my ability to use word processing softwares such as Google Docs, Word, etc. The goal of this assignment is to talk about certain objects that one would use in an office and how I had to choose specific items that would be beneficial to work ergonomically. First off, I chose a desk that has a lot of space. I chose a chair that forces the user to sit in a good posture. I talked about a microsoft ergonomics mouse that is shaped and angled to how your hand would naturally be. Same as the keyboard which is shaped to how the formarms would rotate making the typing feel more natural. I also picked a monitor that can be adjusted in many different ways that can meet the needs of the user.

    <h2 style="background-color: #4CAF50; color: white; padding: 10px;">Catholic Social Teachings Connection</h2>
        <p>
<b>How does what I've learned in Business and Technology relate to the Catholic Social Teachings</b> One catholic social teaching that I can relate to my time in business and technology is rights & responsibilities. In this class I’ve learned many things: word processing software applications, presentation software applications, spreadsheet software applications, how to code in HTML, and more. The catholic social teaching of rights and responsibilities tells us that we must be responsible with our rights, we must use them for good by not doing any harm with them and by helping others. An example of this is that for a part of the course, we’ve learned how to become a good digital citizen without causing any harm to someone on the internet via cyberbullying for example because words can hurt and do a lot of damage to someone mentally which is why with the ability to access the internet, we must be responsible do not do any harm to others.
